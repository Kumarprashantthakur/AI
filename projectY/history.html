            <h2>A Timeline of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

            <p>
                The idea of creating intelligent machines has existed for centuries.
                However, Artificial Intelligence as a scientific field began to take shape
                during the mid-20th century with the development of computers.

            <h2>Major Milestones in AI History</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>1950 – Alan Turing:</strong>
                    Proposed the famous Turing Test in his paper
                    “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” to measure machine intelligence.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1956 – Birth of AI:</strong>
                    John McCarthy introduced the term “Artificial Intelligence”
                    at the Dartmouth Conference, marking the formal beginning of AI research.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1950s–1970s – Early Development:</strong>
                    Creation of early AI programs such as Logic Theorist and ELIZA,
                    which demonstrated basic problem-solving and language interaction.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1974–1980 – First AI Winter:</strong>
                    A period of reduced funding and interest due to limited computing power
                    and unmet expectations.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1980s – Expert Systems Era:</strong>
                    AI gained commercial success through expert systems designed to
                    replicate human decision-making in specific domains.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1997 – Deep Blue:</strong>
                    IBM’s Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov,
                    proving machines could outperform humans in complex tasks.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>2000s–Present – Modern AI Boom:</strong>
                    Advances in data availability, computing power, and deep learning
                    have led to breakthroughs such as voice assistants,
                    facial recognition, and autonomous vehicles.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Today, Artificial Intelligence has evolved from a theoretical concept
                into a powerful technology that plays a vital role in everyday life
                and continues to shape the future of humanity.

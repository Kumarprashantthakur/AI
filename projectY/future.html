        <h2>What's Next for Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>The future of AI is incredibly promising, with research focusing on making AI more general, more ethical, and more integrated into daily life.</p>

        <h3>1. Achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</h3>
        <p>The long-term goal is to move beyond Narrow AI to AGI—systems capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can. This would unlock exponential growth in technological advancement.</p>

        <h3>2. Hyper-Personalization</h3>
        <p>AI will lead to an unprecedented level of personalization in all services, from education (customized learning paths) and healthcare (precise, individual treatments) to entertainment and shopping.</p>

        <h3>3. Ethical and Transparent AI (Explainable AI - XAI)</h3>
        <p>Future development will focus heavily on **Explainable AI (XAI)**, which means creating AI systems that can clearly and simply explain *why* they made a certain decision. This is crucial for building trust, especially in critical fields like law and medicine.</p>

        <h3>4. Symbiotic Human-AI Relationships</h3>
        <p>AI will increasingly act as a partner or assistant rather than just a tool. This could involve advanced collaborative robotics in manufacturing or sophisticated AI co-pilots for complex professional tasks.</p>

        <h3>5. Breakthroughs in Quantum AI</h3>
        <p>The merging of quantum computing and AI could unlock computational power currently unimaginable, allowing for simulations and problem-solving far beyond the reach of current technology.</p>

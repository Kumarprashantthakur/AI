        <h2>Welcome to the World of AI</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative and rapidly growing technologies of the modern era. It refers to the ability of machines and computer systems to simulate human intelligence and perform tasks that normally require human thinking. These tasks include learning from experience, understanding information, solving problems, making decisions, and improving performance over time.</p>

<p>At its core, Artificial Intelligence focuses on three major processes: learning, reasoning, and self-correction. Learning involves the acquisition of data and rules for using that data. Reasoning allows machines to apply logical rules to reach accurate or approximate conclusions, while self-correction enables systems to improve and refine their outputs based on feedback and past results.</p>

<p>This project explores the fascinating and ever-evolving world of Artificial Intelligence in detail. It covers the history and evolution of AI, its different types, important technologies, real-life applications, advantages, disadvantages, and the future scope of AI. From healthcare and education to transportation and entertainment, AI is transforming almost every sector of human life.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work. As technology continues to advance, AI is expected to play an even more significant role in shaping the future of humanity by increasing efficiency, accuracy, and innovation across industries.</p>

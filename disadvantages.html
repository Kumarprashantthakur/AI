            <h2>Challenges and Concerns of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

            <p>
                Despite its many advantages, Artificial Intelligence also brings
                several challenges that must be carefully managed to ensure
                responsible and ethical use.

            <h3>High Cost of Development and Maintenance</h3>
            <p>
                Developing AI systems requires large datasets, powerful hardware,
                and skilled professionals. The continuous cost of maintenance and
                updates makes AI solutions expensive for many organizations.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3>Job Displacement</h3>
            <p>
                Automation powered by AI can replace certain human jobs,
                especially repetitive and routine tasks. This may lead to
                unemployment in some sectors if reskilling is not encouraged.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Lack of Human Emotions and Ethics</h3>
            <p>
                AI systems function based on data and algorithms and do not
                possess emotions, empathy, or moral reasoning. This limitation
                can cause problems when decisions require human judgment.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Bias and Discrimination</h3>
            <p>
                AI models can inherit biases present in training data.
                If not properly monitored, these biases may result in
                unfair or discriminatory outcomes.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Security and Privacy Risks</h3>
            <p>
                AI systems rely heavily on data, making them vulnerable
                to cyber-attacks and data breaches. Additionally, AI-generated
                content such as deepfakes raises serious security concerns.
